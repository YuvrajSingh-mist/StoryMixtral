Once upon a time  there was a little girl named Lucy. She was very happy, and always wanted fun. But she had trouble sleeping at night and all nights.

Every night it had all kinds of noisy people playing with bins. She did not understand why they were so loud. But every morning she would wake up to a soft sound.

On the next morning Lucy woke up feeling a lot better. She couldn't wait to go outside and see them! She put on her red shoes and grabbed a bag of shoes with a big smile on her face.

Lucy was so happy to learn that day that she couldn't wait to do it! The next morning she could hardly wait, she took a deep breath and put her shoes on.

For the third time, Lucy loved wearing her bright yellow shoes. She ran around the yard and enjoyed the day. Every night, she made sure she ran outside and said good morning.

Lucy was so thankful for her shoes, and she always remembered to bring them whenever she went outside to play. She was so thankful that she was able to enjoy the boring days playing in the sunshine!

The end. Lucy's Mom and Dad told her she had done very well in her first day of school.

The End. Lucy loves her school, and she knows that she can always come back for a sunny day and that it was the best day ever! 

The End. Lucy loves spending time with her Mommy and Dad, and she knows that no matter how loud, Daddy will always remind her of that special day. She loves it! And she loves to learn new things. 

And she is not as tired as before! She never forgets that happy days and the quiet routine she shared with her Mom and Dad, and how great it was to go to school. 

And that is how Lucy found out the secret of the day. She was so happy to understand how much she enjoyed her life. 

The End.

THE: Reading is a time for us to think about and do it, and to remember to be patient and believe in your dreams!

The End.

And that's what Lucy did every morning, bringing in the things she loved. That way she could share the joy of being at home. 

The end.
The end. 
And Lucy enjoyed her morning so much more. She had never been so happy! 

As she went back inside to the house, she was always sure to get a bit less messy!

And the End. 

And that is the story of Lucy and her big, quiet world. She was always so grateful for it! 

The End. 
And that is how Lucy and her 3rd birthday ended - and a full of joy each that followed! 

THE her Mom and Dad for the first check up and that made her so very happy.

And from that day on, she always kept her red shoes with a smile on her face, and she was happy to stay a little girl who remembered her journey with a light smile. The End! No one else could teasing her, but Lucy wasn't afraid to take her shoes on the icy street. She's grateful for everything, even though they won every year - sometimes! 

THE, every morning was filled with magical energy and fun for her 3rd-year-Today.
But no matter what, she always makes sure to bring her bright red shoes with her and enjoy her story of her first day!  If you ever forget, Mom and Dad will always be there to show her how amazing and fun and happy every day. 

The End. If you take the days older, she'll learn a powerful lesson! And then, that's just like a fine yellow shoes.  The end.

The end.


And Lucy will always remember that special day. Even if it disappears all the way? 


The end.
It's important for all of us to remember the joy and love you put on each day. And don't forget: no matter how much you get to know something in life will always be an adventure that no one can forget! She's loved! No matter how big or loud Sarah's story comes true; that everything in life is filled with joy, and thatâ€™s exactly what makes every day special. It's one she will always remember! 
And every day, with Mom and Dad's laughter, in her mind of showing her love and joy to all
