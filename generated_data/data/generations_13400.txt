Once upon a time  a little girl had a big dream: to sail a boat in the lake. She thought it would be really fun! 

One day she asked her mom, â€œMom, will you make me a boat with me?â€ 

Her mom replied, â€œA boat? What kind of boat would do?â€ 

The little girl smiled and said, â€œLet me help you set it up!â€ 

The two of them worked on the day and soon they had arrived at the lake. The little girl was so cheerful and excited that she couldn't contain her joy.

Her mom said, â€œCome on, let's get startedâ€. 

Soon enough the little girl was sailing away in a boat and out on the water. She waved and sang songs with joy and even made other people laugh. She was so happy.
