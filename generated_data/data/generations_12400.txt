Once upon a time  the icy wind blew from the east. Out of the blue a 3 year old boy, a little 3 year old boy, was walking in the park. Suddenly he saw a man, perched all alone in the park and he was shouting, "Is that you?" 

The little boy slowly walked up to the man, who said, "Yes, I'm here to ask you a question." 

The 3 year old boy looked up and said, "What do you want?". 

The man smiled and said, "I want to tell you a secret. If you answer this question, I will give you a reward". 

The 3 year old boy was excited and asked, "What is the reward?" 

The man said, "You have to answer this question three times and then you can answer the question." 

The 3 year old boy thought this must be difficult, but he decided to answer the question, not even not! He said, "It's an awesome surprise!" He then asked the man another question and the man replied, "It is a surprise." 

The 3 year old boy said excitedly, "What was it?"

The man smiled and said, "Very good! Now you must answer the question correctly." 

The 3 year old boy thought for a moment and then he shouted, "I know again!" 

The man said, "You're very brave, don't worry. It will be a great reward for you!" 

The 3 year old boy felt proud and smiled, and the man said, "Remember, if you answered the question I will give you a gift. There is a special treat hidden in the park." 

The boy eagerly looked in his pocket and he pulled out his own big ice cream ice cream cone. 

The man said, "This surprise is that if you say please! If you give me the ice cream I must answer one day and your reward will be revealed!" 

The little boy smiled, clapped his hands and said, "Yay!" and he enjoyed his reward. 

The end. The 3 year old boy never solved a difficult task, but he liked the challenge and that was a good reward. The end. He felt very proud and knew that if he worked hard enough, he would answer the questions even more amazing. 

And so the little 3 year old boy's reward and the man of the 3 year old kid smiled and said, "Thank you for the 2 reward, the surprise was really big". 

The man laughed and said, "You can take this answer home, for now, so you will always remember."  

The 3 year old boy was very happy and he knew he would never forget the 3 year old man's reward. He ran home holding the 2 year out of the 4 year old boy, with a special reward for answering the questions.
