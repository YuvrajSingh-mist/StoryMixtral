Once upon a time  a little boy named Jimmy was walking around the park when he saw an enormous tuna shark swimming in the lake. He got so excited he started to shake! 

"What are you doing, Joe?" asked his dad, who had been watching the whole thing. 

Jimmy said, "I want to mention this enormous tuna shark!" He ran over to have a look at it. 

"It must be big!" his dad said. Then, he noticed that someone was swimming around it, and he asked him what the tunafish was doing. 

Jimmy laughed. "It's playing with a boat!" he said.

His dad smiled. "You sure are, Jimmy. Let's play with the tuna shark together!" 

Jimmy beamed and the tuna shark swam away, happy and excited to play with Jimmy. He couldn't wait to show off his enormous shark to his friends! 

The end. 

Moral of the story: It's important to think about how you might want to have fun with an enormous tuna shark, but that doesn't mean you can't really! Always have that, even if it's something you think is funny you actually have!" 

Jimmy's friends all agreed that there was no better way to have a fun time!

The End.

Jimmy smiled and waved goodbye as he and dad walked away. He had learned a valuable lesson about the importance of being modest. 

The End!

Moral: Make sure you have fun, as long as you know that you can have fun! Don't forget! When you explore, you might end up in great situations like an enormous shark!" 

Jimmy and his dad were soon off to explore something new, and Jimmy kept to the reminder of his amazing day with the tuna shark! He even tried to tell his friends about it later. It was so much fun! 

The end.

Moral of the story: Oxygen and shark can be very impressive! We don't always have to be near and enjoyable! It's important to stick to the real wonder of it. The most important thing is to treat an ordinary life with the help of family and friends. 

The end.

That's why it's important to be proud and share our adventures with those around us, no matter what".
