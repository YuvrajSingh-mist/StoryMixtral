Once upon a time  there was a little girl. Her name was Sophie. Sophie was three years old and she had lots of fun toys. One day, she went to the park to play on the swings and her favourite toy, a ball.

While she was playing, she heard a noisy, low clapping coming from a tree. She looked at it and saw a girl making the noise. Sophie walked closer to listen. She was so excited!

Sophie asked the girl, "What are you doing at the park?" The girl said, "I'm playing by ourselves". They were both very loud and bossy, so Sophie wasn't not sure what to do.

Then, the girl started to sing a special song. Sophie loved it and listened until she started to get better. Before long, she was having a hard time singing a song on the ground! Sophie was so happy that she could make the girl's voice beautiful. They finished and then played together until the sun went down. Then, the girl waved goodbye to Sophie and skipped away. Sophie smiled with joy. She had made a new friend! She would never forget that moment. 

The end.

The End. You never know how much joy will come from playing by yourself, Sophie? Remember that you always have your best idea: be creative. That's how we can always find new adventures!â€™

The moral of the story is: don't be too noisy! Just be yourself! Be creative and you can make the best of it. Find your own strength and never give up. Have fun!â€ 

Sophie said goodbye to her new friend and went home happily. She learned that being creative can make a lot of wonderful things to do. That it's important to be open and use your words. You can make wonderful discoveries and discover new things. Keep that away!â€. 

The End. By listening to others, anything is possible. Just like Sophie's singing and dancing, she will always remember that wonderful moment. And her friendship with her best friend the girl will always keep going! It's a way of showing courage and bravery! It is always a way to express yourself and be creative. Oh, that it is good to be loud and messy so you can play safely! You can use your time and your best interests to stay happy. What a great adventure!â€™

Sophie understood the lesson that no matter. She had been creative and had found a way to stay serious. But she was also too happy to be back home. She thanked the other girl and said goodbye. 

The end.

Moral: No matter what, it's important to stay open to things, be open to new opportunities and stay happy. Always listen carefully when your curiosity might get you into trouble. That's the power of happiness. When you use your imagination to do something special, you can make it truly more exciting and open people! You can make the best of everything and also be close to it. Well, be jolly! Always remember the power of your heart and your creativity. And don't forget to listen to my heart, for you can make many more amazing things! The end.â€™

â€˜That's me too!''

The end!
No more - no more!''

The End.

Moral: Be creative and don't stop making your own possibilities and never forget to use it together! Always remember to come back to the park, try to create new and exciting things. You never know what you might find, if you keep using your imagination! Be on the courage and your own heart. Be open to new experiences and explore the most wonderful ones!â€
