Bob smiled and said, â€œYes, I like ice cream.â€
Bob was very happy and quickly picked up some money from the ground to give them around. But he dropped his money on the ground and it got his an itch on his arm. Bob said, â€œOh no, my heel hurts!â€ 
Bob sighed again and said, â€œLetâ€™s look around and see what we can find.â€ 
They looked up and saw a squirrel. Bob asked for help and the squirrel said, â€œJust one more time and weâ€™ll know what to do.â€
Bob thought about how all the money might need to be left. But he was very tired and wanted to go home. 
So Bob said, â€œWait! Letâ€™s just enjoy the treatâ€™.
