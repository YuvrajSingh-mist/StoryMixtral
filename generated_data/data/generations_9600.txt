Once upon a time  there was a little girl who wanted to pick something special. She saw something rare and she wanted it, so she went to pick it. When she looked at it, she saw it was a beautiful, rare flower. She was so excited that she picked it and put it in her hair. She showed it to her mom and said "Look, mum! I picked this flower." Her mom said, "That's a very special flower. You found it very rare!" The little girl liked the flower very much and held onto it tight while she picked flowers. She kept it a secret and took very good care of it. The end.  Everybody was so happy that the little girl had picked such a rare flower. She told her mom, "My mom gave it to me and I picked it for a special show." Her mom smiled and said, "That's a very special flower, and you should keep it safe." The little girl smiled and held onto her rare flower every day. She was so proud of her rare flower being able to pick so many special things. The end. The end. 

The end. The little girl looked at the flower and realized that her mom had let her pick a flower, so she knew this was a lesson she would never forget. She learned that it is always important to choose something rare and special. That is the moral of the story. So you can always choose to appreciate your own things, and still be special. The little girl smiled. She was very happy that she had the rare flower. 

The end. The little girl learned the value of respecting things. She never stopped cherishing her rare flower and she was always reminded of the story her mom told her. She would always be reminded of that special moment. The little girl was very lucky. She was happy knowing she could bring something unknown to life wherever she went. And she was sure to always keep her special things and remember the lesson she learned: never take that lesson for granted! She had listened to her mom's advice and had listened carefully. Her rare flower was in a safe place. 

The end. Because the little girl kept her beautiful flower safe, reminded to always remember the moral: Listen to your parents, it's a sign of wisdom and appreciation for the things we have to. The flower was special and it gave you so much joy in such the moments she would cherish it. The flower was part of her memories forever. The little girl was very delighted and they both enjoyed it very much. 

The end! This story teaches the moral value of the things her mom teach her, and you should look for the special value that is still with her, and that friendship is more valuable than anything. It will take her to the world and make sure that everyone knows its value. It never shows her an opportunity to learn what was important and unique can be worth it. But she also knew that the poem was reminded of her grand prize for a long time. She never forgot this lesson.  The End. The end. Be happy. When you have an opportunity to pick something that makes you happy and it shall show up. 

The end.  The little girl was reminded of the message her mom had given her, and that rare things kept taking care of the memories she had cherish and appreciated. That is why a rare symbol has been one that reminds her to appreciate special things. That's her lesson. She is reminded to always pay attention to the things in life, and she will take special care and look for true love between them. 

The moral of the story: In life, you can accomplish wonderful things. The most valuable lesson of all is to remember that chership is the kind and compassionate people and loving everything with her heart's memories. It's true. And with that, the little girl kept a valuable lesson that love and joy! The end. The flower may have reminded her of the end of the story. The lesson that knowledge can stay with her heart. But this memory reminds her to always show the world her beauty and respect for the things she had, and the memories in her life too. With her friends, and her mom's trust that will give her many new memories. This is it: that life is close, and it will always remember to stay true to your love and help her learn, and make time to appreciate things you have. 

The end.

The end. 

The moral of the story: Listen to your heart and stay close to your heart. Listen to her heart and cherish it. 
And if you listen, keep reminding us to always remember that your heart is the memories, the lesson
