Once upon a time 3-year old Tom was walking through the park. Tom noticed a strange bird zoom past him and started to zoom closer.

"What am I flying?" he asked the butterfly curiously.

The bird stopped the bird and replied "Hello! I'm a special butterfly. I come here very carefully and I'm flying!"

Tom giggled and asked, "Can you see me? Can you fly like me if I zoom like you?" The butterfly then flew over to Tom. Tom was so happy it was so much fun!

The butterfly then asked if it could do something special. "Let me help you," it said. 

Tom was excited and nodded his head. The butterfly waved its wings and flew away.

Tom watched the butterfly fly away. He was very happy and the butterfly was the best friend he'd ever had. After that, the fly was no longer envious - it was having lots of fun zooming around. 

The End! Tom learned the importance of the little bird, who was brave enough to zoom away again. He thanked the butterfly for the best and drove away. As the sun went up, Tom smiled and said: "I'm glad I had your friend Tom to zoom around with." 

The butterfly smiled and said â€œMaybe you would one day.â€ 

Tom smiled and thanked his friend again and again. Then, he zoomed off into the forest, happy and lucky. The end! Tom never forgot this fun day and it was a time he would never forget. 

The end.

THE, Tom was so thankful for his zoom adventure and knew he was so lucky to have seen this. They zoomed off in the sky together and never forgot the clever act of encouraging nature. 

They zoomed together until the sun set, and Tom had had the great day watching the butterfly fly by. He had felt so lucky to have such a great experience together. Tommy waved goodbye and continued its journey in the sky, feeling proud of his new friendship. The end. He had had a wonderful day and now he can zoom around forever. He was so thankful for it and vowed never to lose a good friend. 

The end.

The End. Tom learned to be happy too and he was so delighted he had a wonderful time. Sparing made life such a wonderful time, and the adorable butterfly was happier than ever. 

The End. Tom learned to be proud and not just caring for too long and happy. 
Tom took the lovely butterfly to the playground to fly again tomorrow! He was proud of the butterfly good luck. 
Tom never forgot his amazing experience in the park and he vowed to come back and visit it tomorrow. With a smile on his face, Tom was already back to his dream, ready to share their friendship with the peaceful bird.  He said a smile, thanked the butterfly, content and full of love. 

The End! He and Tom zoomed home happy and thankful, just like the butterfly. Tom would never forget the wonderful and lovely moments he had made such a good friend for each fly. Together, they were the best of friends.  

The end. With that, Tom never forgot the happiness he had in the same dream of his future adventures and his love of travel. He thanked the world for the special experience. It was that the end of his peaceful days of joy and friendship. His friend was very lucky not to forget her adventurous spirit. And from then on, they were both grateful to have Tom as his zoom friend. And they have experienced something wonderful and wonderful.
