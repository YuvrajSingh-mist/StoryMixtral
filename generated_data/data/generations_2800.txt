Once upon a time 3 year old Sam had an exciting adventure ahead of him. He saw the big old wagon and noticed that it was closed. He wanted to remove it to see what was behind it. 

"Mom, why is this wagon locked?" he asked. 

"It's not a place to belong, but it's important.", his mom said. "It's not possible to put things in it without permission or dad will take it."
