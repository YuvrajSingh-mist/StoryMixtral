Once upon a time  a little boy named Toby was playing in his backyard. He ran around on his swing, laughing and having lots of fun.

Suddenly, Toby felt his stomach rumbling. He knew he needed something to eat.

He went inside and his mom had made him some delicious soup, it was his favorite.

Toby's mom said, "Toby, it's time for lunch. Please eat your soup."

Toby said, "No, I want a nice cold sandwich."

Mom said, "You can still have a sandwich with me."

Toby smiled, finished up his soup, and went back outside to play. He spent the rest of the day playing in the garden, feeling happy and warm.

The End. The end. Toby was ready to face some more terrible weather, but this time it was a day he could never forget! He was happy to have his yummy soup and stayed outside to enjoy the day. 

The End. The day was much better with a warm feeling from time to time, and a delicious sandwich for Toby's journey. He never had to worry about the terrible weather again. He couldn't wait to go out and play in his backyard again! The end. 

The end.

THEpe 1. Toby was having a great adventure, and he thought about the stormy weather. He was happy that he had his favorite and was happy to know there was still a chance to have a great day.
 
The end. 
And you know, Toby and his mom would always remember how great the weather is! 

THEcÃ©ated the next day, just as his mom reminded him that the best adventures can be found in the most unexpected places. 

Toby smiled and gave his mom a huge hug. Today was going to be a day he would always remember. 
He knew it would be just as fun as his mom said. 

The end.
He just needed his soup, and he knew that soon it would be the last time he could go outside and explore all he wanted to. 

Then, Toby's mom called from the window, "Toby, Toby! Time to get back on the windy day." 

Toby sighed and said, "I can do that, Mom." 

Her mom smiled and said, "Great choice, Toby. I'm glad that we have this soup with me." 

And they both ate the soup as they ran through the garden to chase each other around, but this time, they had a special day together.  Toby had the perfect swing and the fresh soup.  The wetness of the soup always put a smile on the heart. Toby knew his adventure would soon end, but no longer. Maybe tomorrow, and in the sunshine, he wouldn't be as sad if he was there with his mom. 

And they lived happily ever after.  The end. 

THEting things can happen and give you wonderful surprises... like his yummy, cold soup to rest his heart. Toby's life adventure is even better.

The end. 


THEant 1, 3: full of possibilities! 
And every time you make a wish, remember Tuesday. With love and hope, anything is possible.

The End. But it was something special for him - and he knew his mom had remembered all along the time he had spent with his mom. He couldn't wait to go on exploring and always be prepared for whatever the future held! 

It meant that he'd been prepared and he could enjoy it as long with his mom.

And that's how Toby always had a special, great summer! 

The end. Â 
Together, they would never forget this amazing sun and his adventures, forever. 

The End. 
Like that spring Tuesday was the perfect season for exploring, just the beginning, and anything! 

THEherting his mom? Toby smiled and knew that he would! He kept his chubby heart alive. And he was right- there will always be many sticks of winter for us. 

And to this day, it's still here, just as long as the weather's warm sun, a wonderful rainbow in the skyâ€”the season will live out there, but until the weather is even better! 

Bicy Tuesday may be, but sometimes, the sunsets hold many surpr
