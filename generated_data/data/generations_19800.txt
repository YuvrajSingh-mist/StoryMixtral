Once upon a time icy winter day, there lived a three year old boy. He lived in a big house. He enjoyed playing in the winter wonderland and playing in the snow.

One day, he was playing with some snow toys. He decided to make a snowman, so he put some blue snowballs on the ground.

As he was running around, he slipped and fell, down a nearby tree. He was so sad, but he was still determined to make a new snowman. He worked hard, but it was too hard, the snowman kept slip away.

But the brave little boy wasn't sad. He took a big break from playing and sneezed when he was tired, and he was proud of what he had built. He learned that playing in winter was much more fun than making a snowman on his own.

From then on, he always remembered to work hard and practice his new skills.

The moral of the story is that a little effort and patience can help you achieve your goals! All you need to do is have a chance to achieve fun things. Hard work pays off!â€™ said his family as they hiked by and watched him work hard to make lovely snow sculptures. When winter was over, the snow sculpture brought spring, and it was even more beautiful than the last.

Even at sunset, a winter warmth is sure he'll remember: no matter how hard something is, if you try your best, you keep trying and never give up.

And with hard work and patience, the reward is always worth it. So don't give up hope and practice! You can achieve great things if you stay determined.
