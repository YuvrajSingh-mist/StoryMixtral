Once upon a time 2 small things - John, Sarah, and Steve. They were always doing normal and playing together. One day, John was playing with a red ball on the floor. Sarah was watching him and wanted to do the same thing. She said, "Let's add the ball to my toy car. It'll fit!" Steve's sounded very excited and he said, "Yes, let's do that!"

So, the two of them put the ball on the floor and started to carry it. But on the way, Sarah said to her friend, "We should add more fun, like to play baseball!"

Steve was not sure, but he agreed. The ball was a fit and fun toy, and the two were having so much fun that they forgot all about the round ball. 

As the sun set, they stopped, and put the ball in the corner of the room. That way, they could play without getting the ball stuck in the middle. So when they had seen something, they went to the left side of the room to look for their ball! 

They searched all around, but the ball was nowhere to be found. Finally, Sarah said, with a sigh, "It looks like you'd left the ball there until you had it back. It's only fair!" 

The two friends laughed, and from then on, Sarah always put her ball away when playing with her toys. They laughed, played together, and were very happy. 

The end!

The end. And thanks the helpful red ball, Sarah and Steve, decided to keep playing until it was time to go to bed. They said goodnight to the round ball and went to bed, content with their game. 

THE and Sarah have had an interesting day together, and they know they'd have lots of fun. The end! 

"Let's keep the fun going!" said Sarah. 

Together they smiled as they said good bye, and went off to bed. What a fine day it had been! And, next time, when they played and made something interesting, the clear red ball stayed with them. 

Sarah and Steve never forgot the ball forever, and the two friends, forever and ever. 
The End! 

And that's how Sarah and Steve kept their eyes out for each other and for the special round ball to always stay with them. They were a very lucky family! The end. 

The end. Sarah and Steve kept their round round ball and its fun, and it always made them so happy that they had found the ball together. That is the best way to show it! 

THEants who always wanted to do things on their mind would be much more fun. They knew that together, they would have more fun, than ever to add two more round! 

And that's the story of the two best friends, friendship and fun in the red ball game. They both were very happy. 

The end.

Moral of the story: Life must be comfortable and enjoy playing together. Good friends are special for the long, more important lesson: even if something is great, always be happy for the time they have. Do you agree?''

And that's the story of how the two friends learned the important lesson that a simple and wonderful idea is the best way to find joy. That's what Sarah and Steve think about - and that everything will always be friends! 

And they did indeed keep their friendship strong and true, that it's just as fun to have friends.
And that's why the red ball has the most important memory they'll keep in the heart of the three two best friends. It's the best way to bring joy to others! The end. 

THE, Sarah and Steve will always remember this lesson: always keep the round's memory with them and make sure to keep it in their hearts, always with a smile on our little face. 

And that's the power of friendship. Friends always keep this special feeling in their hearts, reminding them of the special day when it was a reminder that they'd always be together - it's the power of the right and the only way that way, their friendship will always stay nice, light and even a heart could bring great happiness. 

Moral: The story: What is most important? Having a little bit fun and more friendship. When you least expect it, you can make the most joyful days! Dreaming is a great way to explore and be happy to. But also stay that way! That's all! In the end, always love our memories and friendship with those you love. That's the power to have
