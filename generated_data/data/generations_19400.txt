Once upon a time  an old dog called Daisy. Daisy loved to sit in the sun and bask in the warm sunshine. She was always so happy outside. 

But one day, it started raining and Daisy couldn't stay out. She wanted to go play in the rain. She got on and pawed out on the leash. But the rain wouldn't stop for Daisy. 

She barked and barked, but still the rain wouldn't stop for a long time. Until finally, she had an idea. She ran back over to the old shed and started to bark in a loud voice. 

It worked! A whole roly came down the stairs and Daisy ran out as fast as she could! She was so happy and had so much fun playing in the rain. From then on, Daisy was always bossy when it rained, but she was happy and so was the old dog. 

The end. What a wonderful day it had been for Daisy and her jumping into the puddles! The old dog and Daisy would be the best of friends forever. The end. 

The end. 

The moral of the story is that being too bossy or trying to do something that is important for a fun day can be boring. Sometimes, a little bit of joy can turn a boring day into a fun memory. So let's turn something fun into something fun with every family!â€ 
And Daisy enjoyed jumping in the puddles with her friends every time she saw them playing and laughing inside instead. 

Moral of the story: Even when it seems boring, we can find ways to have fun together and have some fun. Together, we can turn the situation into a happy one. So go out and enjoy everything, even in the rain!â€

And that was the end of the old friendship Daisy ever since. She never tried to be bossy again. Instead, she enjoyed playing in the sun and laughing until her furry coat was a brand new chance to have some fun. What a great day! 

The End. The rain was a blessing to the happy days and Daisy was reminded of the importance of friendship and the joy of playing in the sun. She vowed that never to forget how great it was to play outside in the fresh rain. 

The End.

The moral of the story is: Sometimes it's better to use our imagination than always have a chance to have fun. Sometimes you just have to take the plunge. And remember - even when the rain isn't perfect. Sometimes, the best solution is to be creative and have fun! What's most important was that all of you should have fun everytime it rains!â€™ 

Daisy was once again so excited for the next time she could play in the rain, and it never has appeared - happy with what she found in the old shed.  From that day onward, Daisy knew that a little creativity can be filled with joy when you have a special friend to make you feel happy and fulfilled by her adventures in the sunshine. There is always a bit of love to turn!â€! 

THE today, Daisy has shared her secret with all the things she loves. And whenever of an old dog's idea turns out, we get another idea in order to stay alive. You never know what else might be out there waiting for you. Always remember that! Just around the corner you need to know - sometimes, a little thing can just turn a broken out. 

The End. 
There: Having something boring and having fun can bring you together as a wonderful new experience! Daisy thought to herself and in this story, you discover the wonders of life. That's the moral of the story. Be willing to take a break from all the joy and laughter of our day. And all you need to do is turn, turn, and enjoy life!â€‹the lesson we all just have a little bit of fun for everyone - but it's even more important foreshadowing this moment. We should find the strength and creativity that our little boring days can enjoy even the most boring days.  Now, the joy and beauty of your world ahead of in the good weather. 

The end.

Moral value: Always take the time to explore or create new memories! This is as the key to finding friendship and the excitement of transforming life! That way you can keep going in the best moments. With a little bit of boring moments, make life
