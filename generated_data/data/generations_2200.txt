Once upon a time  two friends, Jake and Jane, were playing in the park. Sally had a secret box. It was filled with special objects and fun toys!

Jane wanted to have the secret secret. She asked Jerry if she could have it, but Bob refused. Jane said, "No, I want to keep it! Give it to me!" 

Jane was mad and said, "Fine, I won't give you any money." Everyone laughed, and then Jane saw something she didn't want to steal. 

But when Sara grabbed the box, she realised that it was hers! She was very sad and angry. She knew the secret box was not her. 

Jane came back with the secret, and the box she was looking for it! 

Jane was very sad and angry, and she started crying. She wanted the secret back. 

In the end, Jane was so mad that she ran away to find it. She never found her secret again and she never went to play with it. 

The End. The secret was so special that everyone ever saw each other again! They were so frustrated and sad that the secret was closed again. The end.

The end.

No matter what Jane did, the secret one could not always be shared. No matter what Jane did, it was a bad ending. Jane was very scared for her troubled day.  She had no way to escape. She was alone forever.

The end. The End. Jane never saw her secret box again. She would have been a very bad ending to her mysterious secret box of fun. And she never found it again! The end. 

The end. Lisa never got her special box back. She would never be happy again. And Jane always remembered that bad things happened! The end. No matter, Jane was the one who loved the box and had a special gift. 

The End. They never opened the box forever again to be together. No one else ever found it in the end.  

The end. Jane was very happy - she had learnt a valuable lesson - never never own a box again. It was more important for her own luck and she never worried about her friends again again. 

The End. No matter what, Jodie tried to find a new place to explore, even if they were different! But this happened. J quality only is one of the best memories in the world. Now, don't ever ever have a secret again! 

In the end, Jane promised she never to forget to care for anything that might end up to the end. Her secret she was so lucky! 

The End. And Sweet always remembered her secret of friendship and love. And she was happy to have her special hidden box. 

The end! That's the moral of the story - never take something that is not their permission, and it might not take them away. Taking more wonderful, it's always better to be good and honest than ever! Jane learned that no matter what, she should never forgetting. Jokes and wishes are for her own special lesson. She and her secret will always stay with those who care for each other, or anything bad was ever again. Friendship can always lead to wonderful memories that are with both special things. They can be apart forever.
