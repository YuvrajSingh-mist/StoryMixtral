Once upon a time  there was a princess who lived in a tidy castle. 
One day she was walking in the garden when a loud noise disturbed her peaceful singing. She looked up and saw a large dragon flying towards her castle! 
The dragon was barking so loudly that the princess was scared. 

"What's that noise?â€ the princess asked herself. 
Suddenly, the princess heard a noise coming from inside the castle. 
"Don't be scared, Princess," the dragon said. "I'm just guarding the castle and making sure the castle is safe. Were you help me?"

The princess was surprised. "Yes hello," she said. "My castle is even tidier than before. I'm really enjoying you talking!"

The dragon was happy that the princess was being so kind. "Well, thank you for coming to my castle, I'm so grateful!" the princess said. 

After the dragon left, the princess felt happy and safe. She knew that no one should be afraid of something that is made too good to be true. 

From that day on, the princess and the dragon became friends. They spent many days together in the garden, and the castle was always full of sparkling things. 
The end. 

The end. The princess saw the castle's protection and realised that a monster had been a true friend. But she also remembered her magical castle and the fun the two of them shared.  She realized that no matter what kind of things have an effect - it can become a friendly, and a happy one! 

So from that day forward, all of the princess's worries will be complete one day! And no matter when the monster is around, always remember to yield to face it and be kind, no matter how busy the dragon is. We all need to remember that no matter how busy and scary things become, in our own way, there is still a lot to teach us. 
 
And so, with her true heart, the princess and her dragon friend continued living happily in the tidy garden. The end.  The princess will never forget the lesson her dragon friend taught her! 

And that's how the princess, the lively princess, was ready for a new adventure. To this day, they have never forgotten to be brave. 
The princess's castle was filled with peace and quiet again.  The End. 
And the princess lived happily ever after. 
The end.  The end.

Moral of the story: Be brave and use your kindness no matter how big or small a castle, you can be brave and generous. You never know when it might sound. You never know who the most charming!" 

The princess smiled and waved goodbye to her castle friend. As she left the castle, she smiled, knowing that a tidy kingdom could be made in the end. 
 
So, whenever the princess looked at her castle in the heart, "Let's always be brave and strong together! ' No matter what happens, there will always be a new and happy castle!' 
The princess and the dragon never forgot what the princess had done for her castle. They were truly the best of friends! 
 
The End.
