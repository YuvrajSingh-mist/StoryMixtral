Once upon a time  two friends, Jack and Lucy, were playing in the park. Jack wanted to play tag, but Lucy disagreed. Jack thought he should chase Lucy, but Lucy wanted to explore. They argued back and forth and eventually the argument got very crazy. 

Suddenly, a mist started to flow all around them and it got really dark and scary. Jack and Lucy looked around, but they couldn't see where they were going. Then Jack shouted one last time, "I see a zigzag!" and chased after Amy. Just as they were about to get away, the mist started to disappear and the sky cleared up. 

Finally, Jack and Lucy stopped and Jack hugged Lucy. They were very happy to be safe. From then on, they agreed on everything â€“ they would never disagree again. So, whenever they felt upset, they would remember the beautiful fog that had appeared in the sky. They would explore and play together, but they always stuck to the mist.  The End!
