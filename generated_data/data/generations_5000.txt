The girl's dad smiled and said the pizza was available. The girl was so glad. She knew her dad always made it nice. 

The next day dad took the pizza out of the oven. So the girl opened the oven door and pulled out their pizza. It looked even better! They sat down together and ate the delicious-looking pizza.
