Once upon a time 1, three adventurous children wanted to explore. So they went on a big march. First the children started to march around the big trees and bushes. They found lots of exciting things - there were flowers in bloom, trees with birds singing, but the sun was still too bright.

Next they traveled to the beach. They saw the ocean, the sand, and the beautiful fish. It made them so happy that they wanted to march. It was so much fun!

After that, they marched to the city. Everywhere there were noisy noises, so the children were scared. But they kept marching, and soon they reached the beach. It was the best adventure ever!

The children loved playing in the sand, the beach, and the big beach. They would always remember the beautiful noisy march of the big march. The little ones had so much fun in the big march. Everyday is a special journey! And the children will never forget it!  The End. 

The End. The children were eager for more adventures, so they continued counting together and laughing the whole way. They had a wonderful time and never forgot the wonderful march they had seen on the big march. The end. 
The End.

But the children will never forget their time in the march. They will never forget the wonderful time they had marching together at the big march. Every time they look and see it, they remember the beautiful things they did. That makes them hopeful! 

The end. 

The End. What an escape we all would never forget!
Maybe next time, you can look forward to marching with me again! 
So, no matter how excited you are, it's always worth the journey! Oh come on! And dreaming as you think. Dreaming is full of fun adventures that you never knew about. We will never forget this amazing march with you!â€‹

 
The End.
No matter what kind of adventure you learn, be sure to always march along and enjoy the adventure. You never know what amazing things you can find and you might never be disappointed. Good things can be found wherever you're dreaming of! But the next thing you know, the big march will still be here today! And it will always be part of what you do.

The End.

And sure enough, the vacation was filled with adventure and adventures. The children had a wonderful time together on their march. The End.
