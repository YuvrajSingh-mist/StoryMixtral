Once upon a time  A small mouse named Tom wanted to have an adventure. But he didn't know where to go. Then one day he heard about a special cave. He was very excited so he decided to go explore.

When he arrived at the cave it was so big and dark. He went in and it was very dark. He knew it was the perfect place to explore. But what was next made there? People were in danger.

Tom was feeling embarrassed. He knew he had done something wrong. He wanted to go back home but he felt so guilty. He had forgotten that it was an important cave and he didn't want anyone to find out.

He thought about the situation for a quick while. He decided that he would stay near the cave a little longer. Now he wouldn't feel embarrassed anymore because he knew what he might find in the cave. He felt much braver now.

The moral of the story is: it's always important to look for the truth. Even if you really want to explore it, you should never be too embarrassing. It will also lead to an even greater experience. Everyone that meets the truth, then we'll get in trouble. We should never regret a feeling of embarrassment when we leave. Let's stay positive and stay safe."

And so Tom learned that it pays to be careful! He promised himself to himself and to never be ashamed again. He was so proud of himself for being brave and helping others in need. 

The end.
THE story teaches us that it is important to be brave and honest. So don't forget that the most important thing is not what it is to be brave! We should always remember important things, like going to the cave. It's our way to show respect for ourselves too!â€™

Tom learnt his lesson and made sure he always remembers this important lesson. He will never find a map or a mistake unless he takes the time to forgive. He will always find joy in the small things and learn to live in harmony and safety. The lesson is that it won't last forever. Being reckless is bad, but it's also worth learning the important lesson of staying brave and doing good things.â€ 

Tom was very proud of himself and he learnt a valuable lesson. He understood that we should never force a risk to forgive and face new challenges. He learned to always believe in the things that have happened. Being clean and understanding of others will help his courage in life and he knows that he can always get help. That is how Tom learnt to be a better person. That way you can be rewarded in the end. 

The moral of the story is that you should always be open to trying their kindness to guide our friends, no matter who they look. We should all look for the opportunity to make the right decisions. In this case, we can still find the courage in each other's feelings and it always pays the kindness of those who care. And if you're embarrassed that something important can have to offer you something positive, but being a positive attitude is just being a good friend.â€ 

So it's important to stay brave and always be, especially in times of trouble. We never regret getting courageous and understanding of life, no matter how small our courage may lead to bad outcomes and a positive memory of this lesson.â€ 

This is the story we have learned from the moral- you are an example of bravery and courage. Might and commitment will come from even an act of kindness. Respect and accept. So the moral of the story is to never be afraid to try new things. We must never be too embarrassed of ourselves to ourselves and the things we may have to show for forgiveness. We should be brave and be open to doing what belongs to other people. Finding ourselves in life is worth the harm! Always be wise and respectful. Taking too much is never in life. Remember our heart and the happiness of everyone. Always make the right choices, and you will be rewarded with success.â€™

Tom thanked the world for this teaching him. And then, he learnt a valuable lesson from this experience: be proud of the things we show.

And Jack never forgot the lesson his lesson taught him. It is important to stay brave, but it also spread happiness on the world. We should not forget to not be afraid to admit we know a valuable lesson at all times! Nature will teach us all the right thing. Be careful and use wisdom, be generous, not ashore. By the end of the story in life, be brave and try for the best.â€
