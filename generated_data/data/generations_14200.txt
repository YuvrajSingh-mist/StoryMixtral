Once upon a time  a mild day was so nice and sunny. A mommy and her 3 year old daughter were walking along and having fun together. 

The Mommy said to her daughter, "Son, let's go for a walk!" The daughter started to cry and said, "No, I wanna walk!"

The mum felt so sad and said, "Mommy I'm not really going for a walk and this is not allowed. Let's go!" But the mum kept on saying no again and finally said, "If you don't come with me, we won't talk."

The daughter didn't feel happy, but mommy held her tight and said, "I'm sorry but I'm being very mild." 

The next day, the mummy and her daughter came back to the park. Again, the mild daughter said, "I want to go again and this time, can you give me permission?" Mommy thought for a minute and then said, "Of course, you can pay. Let's go!"

The daughter was so happy and she ran to the park as fast as she could. 

And so they both had a wonderful day walking and playing together.

The end. Mommy and her daughter were happy the whole time they had their morning walks, even though their first time in the park was so dull. As they headed back home, the daughter happily said, "Mommy, I did it!" 

Mum smiled, and said, "Yes, you did. You made the walk much better. You can walk wherever it takes you again." 

The daughter felt so proud and happy that she hugged her mummy tightly. Mommy knew she had made the right decision. It was a great day, filled with lots of fun and kindness. 

The end.
