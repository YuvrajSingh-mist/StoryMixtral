Once upon a time  there was a girl called Bella. Bella was three years old. One day, Bella was playing and she saw something shiny. It was a coin on the ground. She picked it up and it looked like it was magic. Then the coin started to sparkle.

Bella ran to show her Mom the coin. Her Mom told her it was a very dirty coin. It had been in the mud for a long time. Bella was excited and she decided to take the coin home. 

When she got home, Bella showed the coin to her Dad. He said it must have fallen off a chimney. Bella and her Mom carefully put the coin in the sink and it lit up in the night. They all laughed and smiled as they watched the coin spin around. 

Soon, the coin stopped glowing and everything became still. Bella never found a coin that looked like it. But every now and then, her Dad would laugh and remember her magical day. That coin was just his way of showing her the time he had with it!

The end. Bella had finally seen the coin that she wanted. She was very happy and so very thankful. Even though it was hard to tell such a thing, it worked very well!

The end.
