Once upon a time 3 best friends, Freddy and John, were playing hockey together. It was a bright day, and everyone was happy.

Suddenly, Freddy had an idea.

"Let's do both baseball!" he said.

John and Freddy each found a pitch. Freddy threw the ball and he scored many points.

"That was fun!" said John.

"Let's do more," said Freddy happily.

The two friends all cheered and ran and jumped. They were having so much fun!

Suddenly, Freddy's mom called out, "Johnny, John! Time to go home!"

Freddy and John stopped and looked around. They saw the police park at their door.

"Yay!" said Freddy. 
Everyone smiled, then they all went inside.

The End! Everyone was so happy.

The three of them had a fun day together. They said goodnight, with a big smile on their faces. 

The two friends never forgot the dark night they had. They smiled and enjoyed the day together. 

The End.

The end.

Freddy and John realised that the best way to learn and have fun together was always the best way to take a break. This made their day even more special! 

The boys looked back at each other, knowing that they had made the right decision. They had found some wonderful answers and felt very happy.

That's one great idea! That's what friends and family are for!


And since that day, Freddy and John have never quit when it tells us to always work together! No!

Moral: No matter what our friends may think, try to accomplish anything. We should always try to think more and share it with each other. It can be hard work, but with a little help, we can find their way.â€

And Freddy and John never gave up! 

The End.

And from that day onwards, Freddy and John returned home with a smile on their faces and a feeling of pride. 

The moral: Being in life, if you do your best and don't give up, you can achieve anything!

The end.

But it helps us never forget the lesson,

  
Toys for the most valuable thing in life!
