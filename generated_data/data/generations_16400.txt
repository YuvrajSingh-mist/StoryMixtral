Once upon a time  there was a pond in a forest. The pond was filthy and full of weeds. One day, some children came to the pond to play.

The children were so thrilled to see the pond. They ran and jumped in the pond. The water was so cool and refreshing!

But, after a few minutes, something went wrong. The water felt really heavy and it started to flood the pond! The children were frightened and quickly swam away.

But it was too lateâ€”the pond was ruined. It was so deep and grey that the children could not get out.

The children wanted to go home and it was a bad ending. But they never did make it. The filthy pond was too flooded and nobody could do anything about it. 

The end. Everyone was very sad. But they all remembered the pond for many years. Without the pond, the children and their families had a bad ending. 

The end. The children never made it back to the pond. All their hard work had failed them. They never got to spend the day in the pond anymore. 

The pond was a sad place but there was no hope again. Life is that the pond is gone. The End. Everyone was sad and the children's days of the fall were no longer peaceful. They no longer had the pond to play with, and they were missing their friends and family. The pond was never the same again. The poor children had been punished. 

The bad ending was never solved. The pond was gone and the children and their families lived happily ever after. The children never forget the terrible pond and the pond. No matter how hard they work it is, they never get the chance to go back in. No one will ever forget this sad story. The end. The pond is still there, but it never has the memory of the dead.  The end. The children are stuck in the bad pond forever. We should always remember to cherish the life lessons we share with our family. That way, they don't forget what had happened. The pond was no longer a happy place. The little pond was never seen again and everyone was very sad. The bad end of their story. 

The end. The pond was gone and the parents' friendship was gone forever. It was the end of the story. The story is a reminder to always keep an eye on you. Don't be over-belief. Have faith for your future. The last thing to always end. Remember that no matter what, and never forget the good times they spent together on the pond. If they had not done such a sad thing and had gotten sick, their home was still strong. But in time, it's all because the End. The bad ending was a warning to them to never forget. Unfortunately, this was the end of the story. 

The End. The endless story has a bad ending. The children will never forget the day the pond turned back. They never get to enjoy its wonders. It was a terrible ending, but very, sad. 

The end. Sarah and her payoff: remember that things can turn out to us the most valuable of all. But to remember, nothing can ever change the end. Even the ones of the children realize the importance of a happy ending. And they will never forget. 
the end. 

The end. 
The End.
They all end for a good reason. But no one can tear that day. The end. In the end, poor children all lived in the pond ever again. 

THE. Do not forget the life of happiness, but sadness. Instead of the pond, or the reality the bad ending of the story. If you know what happened, even rich tears can never reveal. But in the rightful people, the we can never find happiness again.

They all live in harmony. Even in the most gloomy. And the End. Because a reminder of the pond or the moral of the story - never forget that our child is taken away in their hearts! 

The end.

It may keep you from missing out on the true joy. Always cherish the moments that you have, or your happiness will never change. So never forget this lesson we should ignore the disents we keep.
