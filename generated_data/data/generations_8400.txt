Once upon a time  the summer season came. The sky was blue and the sun was shining. Sam and Sally were playing in the garden. Sam took a stick and waved it in the air. He made a pond in the garden.

The garden was very big and clear. Sam and Sally played together in the summer water. They splashed each other and ran around. They had a blast and laughed.

But then something funny happened. They saw a bird! It was a beautiful blue bird with a long beak. It flew away and then the bird came back.

Sam and Sally were so happy they had woken up the bird. Now they play in the garden and look at all the beautiful colors. They waved to the blue bird as it flew away. Sam and Sally had a great day but the day ended with a nice day of playing in the garden and feeling very clear about the blue summer day. 
 
The End. Rain had been lots of fun. Sam and Sally laughed and played in the garden until afternoon, when it was time to go home. They said goodbye with their blue sky and their friendship. They knew they would be back soon to wake up in the spring. And it just felt nice. 

The end. 

The end! When Sam and Sally woke up the next Spring, the blue bird was gone. But Sam and Sally knew they would always remember that day when the bird was back. The end. 

The end.  What happened to the blue bird with the funny summer day in the garden. Instead of running away, Sam and Sally looked for it, but it was gone. They were very sad until the blue bird reappeared! 

The blue bird was back! He was singing from a tree and it was filled with joy. From that day on, Sam and Sally never forgot the magical blue bird. They knew that whenever they looked at it, it would always wink at them. They were very happy and the sun shone brighter than ever. They will never forget it! 

THE for the yellow bird, the man and the blue sky will always shine in the spring sun. They will always remember the beauty and color, and they will never forget it. 

The end.

THE of the blue bird always shines in the summer sun! They will remember the summer and smile. And they know he will always be there. 

THE
The end. Because the bird is still watching over you and Ben. And the blue bird in the summer season, always remembering the happy times they shared outside with their special friend. The end. 

This is the story of the summer summer. Everyone is so glad that they have its beautiful blue birds in the springtime. And it reminds them how the blue bird always comes back. And that's the end of the story. The end. 

The end!". But no matter what time are, they will always remember the clear blue bird who faded away the summer day. The end. 

THE, no matter what happened, Sam and Sally will always stay in the garden. They will always remember the summer day when they saw the blue bird wink, in the sky. The blue weather, the sun, the summer breeze, they will always remember the red beach and the beautiful summer. They will be blessed each time they play together in spring.  The end. 

And they know where they will go to find their blue bird again. And they will never forget it. And they will! The birds will always come back, so that they will never be forgotten. And they will still remember the beautiful blue sunset: true to remember it forever, they were always as close and clear as the bird's message, but they will always keep their blue bird close to their heart. They will always remember the blue bird in the blue sky. 
 
 
 The End. 

What is possible? Just when we hold hands, it is still in the blue sky, just in case of the most wonderful sunset will always be reminded to look out for your dreams and happy moments! But the best of all: it was a reminder of this every day. The lesson we learned that day. No matter how far the day ends up. And always remind us the wink. That's the moral of the story!â€ 
 


The end. 

 Love
And that is how the nice blue bird in the summer always remember it. The End. 
And it never forgets! Keeping the truth and the magic of the bluebird. They will always smile.
