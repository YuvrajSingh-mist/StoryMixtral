Once upon a time icy cold day, John and his mom visited a mill. They were very excited to visit the mill, because it was always so warm and shiny.

When they reached the mill, John asked his mom, "Why is the mill so cold and sparkly?â€ His mom replied, "Because the rain is coming because they need to clean the air so that it doesn't burn our lungs." 

John was excited and smiled. He said, â€œLet's help the miller polish the walls!â€

So Tom got some tools and started to help the miller. Together, the two of them worked on the job. In the end, the millers were much cleaner. The miller thanked John and his mom for their hard work and said, â€œYou were so helpful!â€ John smiled and said, â€œIt was fun working together!â€ 

And everyone agreed, the factory was a wonderful place again. The end. 

The End. John and his mom went home. They both learned an important lesson that day: that when we help each other, even the hardest tasks, it is better to work together with others. We should always be generous and kind to people!â€ 

John nodded in agreement, but he also understood the moral value of this story. He now always makes sure to be kind and generous to those who needed it, even if none of them wanted them as a reminder to do so. 

The moral of the story is: being kind and generous to people, you can all work together, even when it's hard, but never forget how wonderful it really is. Together, you can make a difference to a cold and uncomfortable situation.â€ 

John smiled and nodded, understanding what his mom said. From then on, John and his mom worked hard to keep everyone safe, no matter how cold or scared they were. 

The moral of the story is that everyone, even a small act of kindness, can be a bit of a helping hand in the future. When we work together, we can make a difference and help others every chance weâ€™ll get a kind heart. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s the best way to help each other.â€

John and his mom nodded, smiled, and thanked the miller, knowing that their help was important.  They gave people a warm and generous and polite heart, which made it a very special place. 

And so John and his mom left the temple, feeling happy knowing that they had made a big difference.  The moral of the story is that by helping one, even tough tasks, can be shining in the sun!â€ 

The moral of the story is that, with the help of others, we will always be thankful and warm at the mill!  It doesn't have to end the biggest job, but it can still make a difference. 

The moral of this story: Be kind and helpful if we share our respect for others. With help and effort, anything is possible with a little love, both. Together, we can find a greater reward if we do this!â€ 


John smiled to himself, remembering this lesson the moral of the story: it is important to be generous and kind, because not only will the work of others can feel the most embraceable that comes from your own abilities. And that by managing to help those in need, be kind to one another!â€


The moral of the story is to always be kind and thought of others. We must help those in need, no matter the task a task may help us and the lesson in small ways. We must always be generous. If we all have something that we should do, take the effort that we can help than any job! We can do so much more when weâ€™ve a better heart. We should always remember that, no matter their missions, work together and encourage each other, no matter what another!â€‹

And most important to remember this lesson. If we put in the effort to do good deals, even the smallest and the warmest of our unbequeals often is something beautiful and striving. We all have done a valuable thing, just in the end! This is the best rewarding treasure of our lives, no matter the task - that no matter how small or old an act may be, in the future they always do a lot. Today in the end is an inspiration to us all, no matter how small the task may seem, it will usually be a part of the world!  If we work together
