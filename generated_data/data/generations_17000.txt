Once upon a time  called Mark had a wonderful day. He liked to play and have fun. 

He took a train to a special station. There were 2 trains on this train with him, and there was an empty station with no one around so he decided to attach a hat to the blue.

Mark then looked out the window, he spotted a little puppy. He quickly wrote his name down â€˜Saleyâ€™ and smiled.

He went to the station and called out to the puppy. â€œCan you play with me?â€ he asked. 
The puppy shook his head, but he said nothing. 

Mark waited for a few minutes and then opened his eyes. He waved goodbye to his new puppy friend and ran off to the next station. 

He had a great day - it was going to be a full adventure. And he and his little puppy, named Joe and sailed away into the sunset. 

The end. They had lots of fun adventures together and they both recommended they do that every day. 

The end. 

The moral of the story is that even when we feel empty, we can still do something good whenever we can. Praying can help us find new places and make new friends. With a little bit of help, we can be happy! So the next time we see someone new, follow their instructions and think of new experiences. And it might be fun!â€™

Mark knew this was true. With his adventure and the hope he got there, he felt like he was part of something extraordinary. And that is the moral of the story: enjoy life and explore, it can be filled with adventure and wonderful experiences. Letâ€™s remember: when we set out on a good adventure, we can make it happen!â€™ 

Lucy smiled and nodded, excited for the future ahead. 


And so Mark and Jove set off on his next adventure. He had learned that even when things seem confusing, when you take the time to explore something and make it happen, you can always find success. 

This is the moral of the story: never stop exploring and never give up. You never know what you might find.â€™ 

The end. 

And with that, Mark and Joe were off on the next huge adventure, eager to explore and learn all they could about. 

Foreshadowing and setup of the day, and all the great adventures they make that day even better! 

The moral of the story is, for the little moments of fun, and the ability to be curious and happy. There is nothing if you are attending your journey.
And thatâ€™s what they have done - to have fun and travel! The moral of the story is that sometimes a little bit of courage can turn into something great in the most familiar way! Friendship and wisdom can come with every step and never be afraid to make the most of the experience! 

The end. 
But the simple lesson is foreshadowing us all â€“ if we wait and watch our dreams come true, our friends are up for the rewards, so that we can make their days full of possibilities. Even through tough moments, they must always stand up for what is right in the end. So never doubt! What goes in life - keep smiling, be open to discover great things - even the most ordinary things can make the best surprises, too.â€™

Lucy the moral of the story: always keep your eyes open for the good, and follow your dreams. Be open and friendly and have fun, and you never know what may come your way! 

THE
And so, with plenty of patience, learning and discovering new places, go off to do something exciting and wonderful! 

End you set the free! 
Jail, youâ€™ll never quit. You never know, anything is possible! All you have to do is look to the end.â€™ 

And with our help, they are always full of extraordinary surprises and a big lesson. Be open to new experiences and discoveries - donâ€™t give up, but come forward!â€™ 
The End.

We can find the joy in life!  Pat is an open heart. Be open to discovering new possibilities. And listen carefully! You can do ever.â€™
