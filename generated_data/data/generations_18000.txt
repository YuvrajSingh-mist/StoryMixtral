They continued to walk, until they heard the perfect loud whistle. Jane asked her mommy, "What is that, mommy?" Mommy replied, "That's the sound of the sun whistling in the day. It's the beautiful sound it makes when the sun shines."

Jane nodded her head and said, "I want to see the sunrise too!" So they continued walking, singing until the sun had gone away. As they walked, Jane heard the most beautiful whistling of the birds.
