Once upon a time  there was a little girl. She was very happy and liked playing with all of her toys. But one night, she was scared, so she went to her bedroom to get a sheet to sleep with. 

In the morning, she got out of bed and went to her room. On the night of the night, she curled up on her bed. Out of the sheet came a funny looking bug that made her giggle. She couldn't believe it!

The little girl decided to have some sleep with the bug. She watched it crawl all around the room, and she felt happy and safe. 

The girl realized that her nightlight was very useful. She could be creative when she had in a dark room, or to stay in bed for too long.

The little girl smiled and said goodnight to her bug and she went back to bed. And with a happy heart, she snuggled into bed and went off to sleep. The end. That night didn't ever forget her fun night with the bug in her room. She was so grateful for her nice and cozy bed. She had the best night's sleep ever and she smiled as she drifted off to sleep with a big smile on her face. 

The end!  The little girl felt safe and happy, knowing that her bug was there with her. She knew that no matter what, her bed always made her smile. That's why she was so grateful for the beautiful bug that made her bed, for it had been a helpful friend!

The End.
And the girl knew that she could always count on her nightlight to keep her company from her nightmares. She learned that sometimes it was ok to be brave, because sometimes the most precious things come.  That night, she drifted off to a peaceful sleep.


 


The moral of the story is that no matter how dark or scared we feel during our nights, our family is always here to keep us safe. So if you ever feel scared, I'm always here to keep you safe!â€™ 

And with that, the little girl nodded, and headed off for a big good night's sleep. She knew that she'll always be safe in her bedroom; with a friend, that, and her nightlight. The end. 
The end.

The moral of the story is that, when things are tough, stay positive and enjoy the moment with something better than the night before. We all need to sleep so that we can keep ourselves company every night. Keeping each night with this lesson can always make us feel better, and the lesson it taught her to have a wonderful night, too. From that day on she never went to bed alone when it was dark, because she did and thanked the bug for always being there for her to stay safe. 

The end.

The little girl was very grateful to have this special secret to keep her safe! She was sure that next time she would have a good night's sleep, the bug would always be there to keep her company. 

What a great memory it was! The little girl had gotten plenty of nights, thanks to her bug. That's the story of how Sue and the night for the next time it rains! The end. 

Whenever you just close your eyes, take a special night, close to your head and make sure you get a good night's sleep. That's the moral of how bad and stupid the night can be. It's important to rest a little night time too often. And that's a simple story to last!  The end.

The end!
And if you ever forget that, you really know!
The lesson was too useful to stay with forgetful things.  When you get enough rest and wake up, even in your dreams, it can be a night to remember, special things, and no comfort-tress! So don't ever forgetâ€‹ have my friends and family, no matter what. Remember to use the nightlight to keep yourself and those who are in need to make sure we always get a lovely night, like the sleeping you go away. You never know when it could become a night of comforting with everyone you know! 
The end.

The End! Be open, kind and helpful to others with all the love and care and protection, for being there to support and protection. Good night to sleep with the help of you, any time you can use that flashlight, remember! You can always pass and keep you looking up to those who know what you need. Use this good night during those days of sleep and stay! And because, if we always
