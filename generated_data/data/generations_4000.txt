Once upon a time 2 friends lived in a big park together. There was a large park surrounded by lots of different equipment to solve. Everyone was excited to see all the equipment because of the equipment.

The first thing that was very big was a slide. All the children loved sliding down it all! They played with their friends until their hands just right. It was the huge equipment that all the children had.

The children's parents found out about this special equipment. It was used for measuring how much fun they could have together. They took turns climbing the large equipment and it was much more fun than they expected.

One day the children saw a huge toy in the park. It was even funny and the other children laughed when they saw it bouncing around the huge equipment. It was so much fun. From then on, the children would go to the equipment every time they visited the equipment park. 

Upon every trip to another park, the large equipment would often be seen, and the children would always have lots of fun playing on it. It was a powerful way to spend a few hours with two big equipment! Every time the equipment visited, they would jump into it with a huge smile on their face.
