Once upon a time 3 friends met on the porch. It was a very long room with lots of colourful chairs.

The three friends decided to play a game. They would put all sorts of toys into different piles. The toys were piled into groups. The friends put the big dolls on the piles. It was so funny that they laughed and clapped. 

The three friends decided to have a competition. The two friends said 'You're the best! 'it's the fastest!' Then the friends counted to three and smiled.

One of the friends said "Let's have a contest and see who can make the much bigger!' Each of the friends agreed. What would it be?

The three friends were very competitive. They worked really hard and used all their strength. In the end the friends were the first! It was a big win and they all shouted in excitement! They all laughed and had a great time. 

The friends were the winner and the third friend had won the contest. She said "You're the winner!" Everyone laughed and smiled. They knew that it was the most fun race they had ever had. They all agreed that it was the best game ever and had lots of fun playing with their popular agreed. 

The friends celebrated until late into the night, still excited for their next game. Each of them agreed to have another race the next day, and it was the best day ever! 
And they all lived happily ever after. The end!  The End. 


The end.
The End.

The friendsâ€™ friends promised that they would play again next time! They had lots of fun playing their competitive game!

It's important to remember to enjoy a time more than a competition that is to share something special. We should always try our best and make our friends laugh and have a great time. That's the best way.â€™

And they all lived happily ever after. The End. 
The end. 
The end. Who said the beginning was the most important thing â€” that they would always be friends, no matter what! 

THEquil: What was your best friendship? Well!
And that is how their friends ended in a lifetime!
