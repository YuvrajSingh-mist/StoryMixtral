Once upon a time 1, 2, 3-years-old, Timmy, and Joe, were walking to the park.

"Where should we go?" asked Timmy.

"Let's go to the playground Timmy, and we know this place and we do sometimes!" Joe replied.

So the three of them packed their gear and headed to the playground.

When they arrived, they were amazed when they saw that the playground didn't look like the ones that boys play with. They saw a group of children playing and running around the popular playground.

"Look, it's a popular playground!", said one.

Timmy and Joe ran over to the playground too. But when they got there, they saw another boy standing in front of the popular toys.

"Sacko, let's play!" said the boy.

Timmy and Joe looked at each other and smiled.

"Okay!", said Timmy.

The boys played together and had a lot of fun. After playing for a while, they packed up and headed to the car home. Timmy and Joe had the most incredible day at the park and they even remembered the lesson he learnt there is to play at someone else who is popular and nice when looking for friends. 

The end. Timmy and Joe were always excited to come back to the playground to join Timmy and his friends. Every day, they'd laugh and play together in their gosity in the popular playground!

The End. Everyone in the popular playground was nice and happy. The group of kids made a new friend because of Joe's bravery.  They learned a valuable lesson that day - it's better to have more joy, than to try to buy something cheap!

And Timmy and Joe were glad. They had the highest playground ever! The two kids would always remember that true friendship made with the popular kids. The end. 

Moral: If people share their gear to others, it can be a great present. To play with people, we can make a special sign to remember the value of everyone's friendship. 

Timmy and Joe had learnt an important moral value - it's important to always share things, and to not compare yourself in anything! It's more fun when everyone had learned, than expected to have a sign. The moral of the story was that it's better to share the love of others.

The moral of the story is that it's important to always be sharing and help each other than to be sad and alone. We should also share the fun he gave to others. So enjoy their friendship?â€

The moral of the story is that it is important to be kind and generous - so everyone can share, stay happy and be very popular! So, the whole next time, they made sure to share and be kind from then on. That's why it's important to share with others and stay popular!

That's what makes us more popular, the more important you can bring in.

Moral: Sharing is great! The bad things can happen when it's spreading their joy. Good treats can bring people smarter than ever and be happy there. And from then on, it is a hug to always share with your friends. 

The end.

Moral: Kindness is the best way to show love. It never gives up and spread pride and joy. We must always bring happiness and happiness to new friends. Together should be the most popular and unique in the world. What matters is to enjoy nature.

The next time, the most delicious treats, and make sure to be generous, kind. And, always remember the popular toys, and their friendship. 

The end!

And whenever you remember how it spread, there will always spread happiness to us. With generosity, we will be the most popular in the group! 

And that is how Timmy, Timmy and Joe made the world a better place. The moral of the story is to be kind with the most people of the area. With love. Together and kindness always. The most important lesson was to share!â€™


Bye by kindness and generosity. We can all make a difference! We can make everybody around each other to be happy and happy!

The more the kids around us or bring happiness to everyone. We can open the fun and happiness with kindness and joy.

The end.

Moral: Sharing is caring! Friends are found in showing the way. Remember
