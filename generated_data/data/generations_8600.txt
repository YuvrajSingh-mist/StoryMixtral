Tom wanted to play, so he started to spring up and down in the hay. He was so clumsy with the hay that it made it harder for him to spring. Soon Tom felt very tired. 

He stopped and watched as the hay crushed his hands. Tom looked around at the fields, when a bright idea popped into him! He smiled and started to pick up small piles of hay. 

After a few hours of work Tom had gathered enough hay to make a big cushion for a cocoon. He was finally done building his cushion!
