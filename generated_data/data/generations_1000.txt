Once upon a time  two friends named Alex and Sam, each of them were always playing together. 
One day, Jimmy had a special idea. â€œLetâ€™s look for something in this junk!â€

Peter agreed. â€œLetâ€™s try it!â€

Peter agreed, as he started walking towards Sam. But when they were about to pick up a big, round box with shiny branches. He looked closely at the box. 

â€œWhat are this?â€ His mum said sadly. â€œThatâ€™s my secret! Letâ€™s share it!â€

And so they grabbed the small, red block from the box and started to spread it at each other and then it would be fun. 

They both decided it was a great idea and they both smiled, laughed at the fun rolling down the hill. 

Once it was time to go home, Markâ€™s mum came inside. â€œLetâ€™s go,â€ he said. â€œBut why donâ€™t worry about us?â€ 

And so they did, and the mice shared every bite and had a great time. They went home, playing together and being happy. 

The end. 

Eventually, they were all so cold. 
Jack and Suzy couldnâ€™t wait for dinner! They ate spicy food and were very happy to be together. 

Then, all their friends got in the box and they were so glad they had lots of fun. 
 
The next day, they were home with nothing more special and clean - but it made them both very happy. From that day on, they were never ignorant!
