Once upon a time  a small boy named Freddie was walking near a big lake. He wanted to explore the lake and see what he could find.

Suddenly he saw something shiny and interesting in the water. He asked his father, "What is it, Daddy?"

His father replied, "It looks like it's a boat!" 

Freddie was excited and he decided he'd try to catch it. He walked closer and closer to the edge of the lake to the boat, but it was too far away. He tried again to get a bit closer but the boat wouldn't move.

Just then, a friendly voice called out, "Hey there, why don't you let me help you, little one!" It was his neighbour Tom. Tomty had followed his dad's instructions and was able to get the boat closer to the boat.

The boat docked safely in Freddy's hands and waved goodbye to the lake. Freddie and his dad were so happy. They both said, "Let's never forget this adventure!" 

And that is what happened when Freddie and his dad saw the lake in a much better way. They also learned the moral value that it's important not to go too far out of the way. The boat was harmless, but it had a bad ending. From then on Freddie and his dad went to the lake many times. They always managed to get to the lake, but they had lots of conflict in their plans!
