Once upon a time  a little boy named Jack and his mommy were walking through the forest together. Jack wanted to go to the beach, but Mommy didn't have enough money to pay for the beach.

Jack got a big red bag and put some toys in it too. He gave it a big wink and walked along. Suddenly, he saw something in the distance - an oasis!

Jack looked at the oasis with wonder. He started walking towards it, but it wasn't long before there was already a huge sneezeing of water came out of the ground. It was very bitter and Jack's face scrunched up.

Mommy came and took Jack's hand. "Let's go visit Grandma," she said, comforting him. So they both went to Grandma's house, hand in hand. 

When they arrived, Grandma was in bed. She had a cup of warm milk in her mouth and Jack could not help but yawn. He drank it slowly and he felt much better. Grandma was happy, too. 

They went home and Jack was so glad that he had remembered to bring his oasis. He knew the water would make Grandma's day better. He couldn't wait to give her a big hug. 

Jack knew that everything would be alright as the day ended. He had a very happy visit from Grandma and was finally much cheerful. He hugged it goodbye and waved goodbye. Jack smiled and nodded along to his own story. With a wink of his nose, he went off into the night.  The end. 

The end. Mommy was so proud of them for thinking of the poor little boy. After a long day of playing in the oasis, Mommy and Jack cuddled up together and took a nap, happy that Jack had enjoyed his visit. Jack knew that he and Mommy would always remember this special life day.  The end. 

The End. The end. Mommy and Jack never had to worry about homework again. And Jack stayed happy and smiling.  He thought back to the yummy lunch and smiled. He knew he could always come back to it until his next visit. He knew he'd always remember it. 

The end. Mommy reminded Jack that he can always be wise and hope for the best. Jack smiled and made Mommy proud. It was because of his love and friendship. He was sure that he had been able to forget the time and find out for him the next time. 

This reminded Jack of the friendship and the wonderful day forever. From that day forward, whenever Jack crossed home, he made sure to keep his oat close by so he could come back whenever he wanted. Jack and Mommy had many more adventures together, but it was also important to remember to take care of himself and the oasis forever. Nothing could get us more than an empty happiness. 

The end. 

Moral: Respect our manners and take care to help out someone else, no matter how much you miss out on a good day. It makes the most special days in the world, with a special memory and a lot of love along the way. 

The end.
The end.

Moral: Hard work and teamwork are very always rewarding. Pray from Grandma, always staying with her and giving herself even closer. He knows that he will always remember that special visit of a loving and positive friendship. It's the last one he will never forget! And every Tuesday, he makes sure to go to bed and sleep. And that's something that Jack will always remember. That's to think about the lesson, be wise and remember to use wise words and wisdom. 

The End. Jack had made a promise in an end. And his will of friendship never ended. But it was because it was foreshadowing at Mommy's, forever living the end. But Jack will always try his best to remember to cherish the journey. The end.

The end. But Jack will surely always remember that hard work and trust are the best. And the story reminds us not to forget that life is precious and that you should keep it and help those in unfamiliar ways. Everyone should remember our bond, no matter the most important thing. With patience, always remember, to look in the heart and hope it will take this lesson in order, even in the end! 

They both knew that the best way to make good memories were to the heart and face. Just like the lunch and the will, no matter who
