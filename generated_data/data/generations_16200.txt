Once upon a time 10 year old Jenna was playing in her room when she heard a noise coming from the living room. She quickly ran to the living room to investigate the noise. When she got there, she saw her grandma on the floor, sweeping and shaking the furniture. Grandma looked nervously at Jenna and sighed.

"You better stay away from Grandma Paws," her mom suggested.

Jenna asked her mom "Why? Why can't she talk to me so nervous?"

Grandma smiled and explained to Jenna that she had been living in her house and she was not allowed to open the door for dinner.

Jenna looked embarrassed and nodded her head. But she knew that her mom was only trying to keep her safe, and that it was for her safety.

Aunt M Ray said "Let's put a little less here so we can both play outside."

Jenna smiled and nodded her head. Her mom thanked them, then they all went outside together. Jenna happily played with the kids happily in the green grassy field.

The moral of the story is to not be too nervous to ask for help. It may seem like a good idea! If you stick to it, you might be able to experience something beautiful and bring peace. So don't be afraid to ask for help if you find yourself in a mysterious situation. And if not, don't be afraid to ask if you can't help someone today. It's always important to ask for help, and that might seemingly helpful.

Jenna and her mom smiled and nodded, and knew that everything would be alright soon. They went into the kitchen and Jenna happily listened to Grandma's stories. By helping her, the family found peace, joyfulness and safety. She was so glad that she had asked her mom for help. 

Moral of the story: Never give up on helping someone in need, even when something looks exciting. A simple, simple act that is more likely about finding beauty and peace. It will help you to be generous and make the world a better place.

Amy thanked her mom for the reminder and hugged her. She learned a valuable lesson that day- that it is important to be kind and helpful to those around us, because kindness and courage are essential.

By being curious and willing to help others, Jenna learnt to always remember that it is better to be kind than ignorant and to appreciate the world around us. A light shine is something to remember!

The moral of the story is that it is important to be kind and willing to help others in the first place. There are great things in life that are not expecting - and helping as a family. It is also important to be understanding and gentle with others and always stand in a positive way. Listening to the heart is caring and kindness is the best way to reach whatever goal is possible. From then on, Jenna used to live a modest and loving life with others' words, and that's a valuable lesson. As Jenna grew older, her mom couldn't help but remember the good deeds of her mom and dad, and to stay humble and determined. It's important to always stay calm and ask for help from a family, and never forget the lesson that will help us in the end. We should always try to face your fears and help others through the simple words. It is important for them to follow the heart's example so that we can accomplish anything that life brings us. That is something to be proud of!
