Once upon a time  a little girl called Hannah was playing outside with her friends. As she was running around and playing, she heard her Dad say, "Come on Hannah, let's go!"

Hannah was excited, so she ran to her Dad and said, "Daddy is here!".

Her Dad was very happy to hear this and he said, "Oh, Hannah, it's time to take a shower!" 

So they went to the bathroom and Hannah's Dad put some lotion around her. Then, he said, "Now, stay close and make sure the water is running."

Hannah said, "No Daddy, I don't want to stay in the shower."

The Dad said, "If you stay here and take a shower you'll get even yummier! I won't allow it to be a mess!" 

Hannah was embarrassed but she followed her Dad and went into the shower. After she was finished, her Dad gave her a special treat and said, "This drink is for your health! Now go back to bed, and you can have a good night's sleep!" 

Hannah happily went to bed and soon fell asleep. She had a beautiful shower and it was all worth it, even for the rest of the day. 

The end.
