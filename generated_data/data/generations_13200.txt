Once upon a time  a little sheep named Lucy lived in a tiny farm. Lucy was always excited today because she was about to meet an ugly wool sheep. As she wandered through the meadow, she got scared but her curiosity made her want to explore more of the world. As she strolled through the meadow, she got more and more scared.

Suddenly, she stumbled upon a huge, white sheep called Squeak. Squeak was dressed in bright green. The grey sheep looked up smiling. "What's your name, little sheep?" he asked in a kind voice. Lucy shrugged and said, "My name is Lucy". "And that is a brilliant name Tommy!".

Wool was still scared, but he tried to be brave. He took a deep breath and said, "I'm sorry for being scared. Do you want to be friends?" Lucy smiled a big, happy smile and said, "Yes, but I'm still too scared to play." So, Squeak and Lucy quickly became friends and Lucy was not scared of the ugly wool sheep anymore. Whenever he was in trouble she would always give him a big hug. 

Lucy and Squeep remained close friends to this day. They have found great joy in exploring the meadow together.
