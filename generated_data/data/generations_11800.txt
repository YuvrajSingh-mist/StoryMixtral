Once upon a time  there was a little boy named Tom. He was three and he liked running and jumping. One day he saw something beautiful - a beautiful vase that was glistening in the sun. He couldn't stay where he was and began to walk closer to the vase.

Suddenly, it collapsed and broke! Tom was very scared and he started to cry loudly. "What happened?" said his mom.
He began to cry even more and said, "I just wanted to see the vase".

His mom said, "Don't worry Tom, you can always come back and visit it any time it's not broken."

Tom looked up into the night sky and said, "I won't leave this beautiful vase behind."

The moral of the story is that when you come to a chance and care for something, you should take care of it and put it where it belongs. That way, you can find happiness when you come back to this one that has been here with you. And one day, you will be able to come and leave it alone just like you wanted to."

Moral of the story: Listening to the advice of others can make us happy, even if we have something wonderful for the vase. We can enjoy every moment and then show respect for it - or we may drop it and forget our lucky day. But then something terrible needs to be done. So, remember that the things we have with it will always bring us back to someone, no matter how small it is. With a little bit of love and care, we can make all those things happen. So never forget this lesson if you take the time to appreciate and care for the things in life. You have lived in it for long.

And ever since then, Tom has been a reminder of how important things have to be discovered and never forget. Even when something is far away or too small, we can still find joy and happiness in it.

The moral of the story is that our will not come easily - the small things in life can't be broken and it can easily break. Everyone has to respect it and admire it, but they make sure to respect it and take care of it. If we don't, it will split and go gone. So always watch it carefully and never leave it alone. If we keep believing, even things that seem helpless can be turned into something beautiful and wonderful. We should always remember not to judge it or try to fix it. Doing this will help our environment and make the world a kinder place, by taking care of it. That's the moral of the story".

Tom nodded her head and said, "Let's always remember the lesson, remember that love can be the most meaningful of when we are not, but the rewards of something small can last forever and spread love. So, never give up hope, and we will be rewarded with love."

The moral of the story: We must try our best not to force things too quickly and make sure that it's the place that truly takes time and effort. If we listen to the advice of those around us, and not let our words and actions become an empty and forgotten task that might be an impacting future. Instead of taking things for granted, sometimes trying to make a bigger mistake. With a bit of heart and care, we can get through this and make someone else who cares. We should remember that even the smallest actions should live in our hearts. Be sure to live an inexome and not waste, instead of anything else.â€ 

When they leave the room, with caution and faith, they will always have hope. And we can all learn to appreciate it a bit more and think twice when we are in need. We may miss our lasting moments, but as the reminder. We should always be thankful for them.â€™

Moral: When we are given something meaning to us and all it, and to take that with a little courage and faith. We must always be mindful of our actions and not let our fears stop us from taking any risky moments. We should always show love and care to this child and we should always be sure, understanding and admire the meaning for being given the chance to embrace it, but also to make sure that it is worth their efforts and joy to the world. We should never quit the small things - or give up hope, but always stay hopeful. That's the beauty in everything we learn. We must be brave and think of the better choice we put, and what is already, to ourselves and our will.â€

Moral: Respect nature and make a good choice and the right things. We must never expect to make the most of the
