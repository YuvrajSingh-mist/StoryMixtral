Suzy held onto her flying suit jackets, "This is the wind. I'm taking my time until you reach the sky!" The wind whimpered her head. Suzy thought for a moment, then nodded to herself.

Suzy grabbed onto the blocks and started to make her way back inside, ready to give the rainbow a hug. As Suzy waved goodbye as the rainbow faded away. Suddenly, Suzy had to come home, and all the plan passed! 

Suzy hugged the rainbow and skipped home. She couldn't wait to tell all her friends about her unusual adventure. It was so much joyous to spend time with the new friends.

Suzy smiled and said, â€œIt was the most wonderful thing Iâ€™ve ever seen!â€  From that day forward, Suzy never forgot the most unique things inside her life when she was playing and imagining she could come home the next time she spent with her mom.
