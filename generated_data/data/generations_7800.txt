Once upon a time  a big, bossy dinosaur named John wanted to play a game. He wanted to know who could get to the top of the tree first. So he climbed up the tallest tree.

John was very fast, but he was determined to get to the top. He had enough of it for his own success. He asked his boss friend, the monkey for help, what he should do.

The monkey said, â€œWhy donâ€™t you come up here? Itâ€™ll be easy, Iâ€™ll encourage you.â€

John thought and he thought, but he couldnâ€™t climb the tree. He wasnâ€™t tall enough!

Finally, he gave up and went home. But he was sad that he couldnâ€™t get what he wanted, and he was about to give up when he realised he would have the chance.

John waited until he was bigger, then got his bossâ€™s advice - to take time to play, have fun and find a way to be the best. 

Johnâ€™s boss was proud of him, it made him feel really good. He realised that even though he wasnâ€™t going to the top, he could still be rewarded for it. He was very proud! 

The moral of the story is that he is still a very popular monkey and he should be thankful for the simple way, but never forget to do it. Thatâ€™s why he is the best jokester in the world. When one day, Johnâ€™s friends found him, and they joined him in his secret game. 

John was very happy and proud. He was glad he was able to get the chance to have a positive, lovely friend who showed in the right way. 

The End! The monkey learned his lesson - no matter what he has, there may be something more important than a bouncy and competitive dinosaur.

The moral of the story is that it's more important to be a good friend than to win a game. A little bit of courage is an impressive part of being a good person. Being careful and working really hard can get him a victory!

John never missed a victory in his competition again! But he was very glad that he took a chance and seen his friend the monkey's secret. The moral of this story is that when you get to success, you will be happier and tougher to catch, but in the end you will always succeed. Because in the moral of the story, you may never forget it!â€ 

John smiled and thanked the monkey by his wise words, and a few more days later. Thatâ€™s why it can bring a special victory with a little bit of effort. He would never be too bored to think about it. He was happy and content that he had been rewarded for it.  He knew that he could always try his best and pay closer to success. 

Moral of the story: Even the bossy monkeyâ€™s advice to make the best of all things. Always believing in yourself and you might make your dreams come true! But be careful in the face. Not always believe what something is. Only in yourself.â€ With hard work and courage, and the will will come true! 

The moral of the story is to never forget to never take risks and be proud of yourself, because of it. Friendship is the best way to reach our goals! No matter what happens, be brave and never giving up. A sense of success doesnâ€™t have to take the chance to achieve his dream and keep taking risks. Being too big and often passes the word! Being true is about giving it away! 

Moral of that lesson: be a little bit more fulfilling and always do the good things. Doing you really appreciate when you get something you want and is rewarded with determination! With just a little bit of determination and care, it can make hard tasks easier. With a word of hope, it pays to be thankful for the better ideas and donives of other, if you have the best judges to reward you. So never forget!

The end. By being a good goal, you gain happiness and a better result. You can be proud of yourself and keep going by trying his best! With enough effort and determination you can achieve anything you set your mind to. It's the satisfaction that will bring joy to your success. Think about that!â€

The end.
