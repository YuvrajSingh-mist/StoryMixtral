Once upon a time 4 year old Tom was walking down the road when he made up a loud noise. He saw many noise and he got scared.

Tom looked around and he saw a giant. He didn't know what was happening, so he walked over. He found another person and said hello.

Tom was very sad because he was scared to talk away.

Then a friendly alien flew down and said hello. Tom asked, "Why are you trembling?" The aliens replied, "I'm scared because I don't know how to get home. I'm lost and I can't find them."

Tom felt sorry for the alien and decided to help the alien find its way home. He said goodbye to Tom and the alien, and they walked back home with big smiles on their faces. Tom felt relieved and happy that he had made a new friend. From that day onwards, he wasn't so scared of meeting new things again. 

The end. Tom had no new friends and had a happy ending. But he also felt a little bit better, as he was so glad to have the two new friends. He was thankful that he could help the alien find its way home. He knew that itâ€™s important to help others, even when we're scared. 

The End. Tom thanked the alien, then waved goodbye. He was relieved and he was looking forward to more adventures. And he never forgot the moral of never taking a chance to meet someone in need ever again.

Tom was careful to be a bit more careful in life. He knew that he had been grateful for the help he had experienced. And he was very happy to be back in his home. He knew it was far away, but he would always remember it. The end. Tom couldn't wait to tell his family all about its kindness. He knew that he could always count on his new friends. And they all said goodbye.

The end.

The end. Tom was never worried again. Every time he saw a friendly alien, he would remind him of how much he loved it. He was so glad that he had decided there was no need to worry, because he knew that he would be sure to cherite a happy world he had, even with hope. 

Tom's humbleness, Tom set off to the alley, and he was so happy that he was back home. He never forgot the mysterious order in the end and he had many more adventures that day.

The End. Tom has been so grateful to have a friendly friend like you and that he had helped the lost alien with kindness, and they all were happy friends. 

Sadly, Tom's memory never forgot the way to the kind planet he shared with the curious astronauts who had promised him to remember things. From that day on, the lonely alien was always there for all the rumbling animals he could rely on. He learnt that being kind and appreciative can help and reminded him that wisdom and hard work are the most important thing in life. And they all lived happily ever after. 

The end.

The End. Tom's life was filled with lots of smile. The people felt glad that he could make his worries go away and he was no longer helpless. He was proud to be a part of the world. He was sure that someday was filled with hope, heâ€™d be safe and that was enough of just one that was now his special home, and he's always there to remember to help. He has made a new friend. 

And thatâ€™s how Tom's kindness brought comfort that sometimes in the most mysterious situation - there are always more to be there when he feels sad or alone.

Tom never forgot it. He will never forget the special times he had with his friendship in his heart. It also to always be ready to make new friends and to be sure they were all there to stay in the little world. And all of his hope filled him back with energy, just like they had. Tom was the bravest girl in the world! 

The end. He knew that it would never be a part of life, but he was thankful to all. And he also knew that being honest and brave can be remembered for the rest of his days. And he never forgot the generous angel. With a special smile on his face, Tom's loyal new companion of all! And they all lived happily ever after.

The End. Tom learnt that being a loyal friend is more important than being alone. He vowed to keep looking forward to the next
