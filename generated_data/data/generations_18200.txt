The 3 year old decided to visit the old man's house. He knocked at the door but no one answered. 

The old man called out, "What brings you here my child?"
The 3 year old said, "We wanted to explore inside your igloo." 

The old man smiled and said, "The icy cold is a part of exploring the world; but it's an ancient home that I only have to offer."
