Once upon a time  the stars in the sky were two little dough friends. They were named John and Sarah. Everyday, they would play and find fun things to do.

One day, the stars, Tim and Sarah found a special toy. The toy was so shiny, it could spin around and make fun shapes. They all wanted to keep it, but they knew they should leave it alone.

So they left the toy behind, but they wanted to play with it again tomorrow.

The next day the sun was out and the next day was bright and sunny! John and Sarah went back to the same spot for it to play, but this time they remembered that they shouldn't quarrel.

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. It was their mom. She had a surprise for them - a special surprise - a shiny new toy airplane!

Sarah and John were so excited! They hugged their mom and thanked her for teaching them such an important game. They were happy to be able to play with the new airplane and play with it on and it was a very special day. The end. 

Sarah and John learned that it's never too late to play together, and they can have many more fun days together. Their mom reminded them that friendship can always be close, even when things don't turn out the way they first wanted.â€™

John and Sarah smiled, and they knew they would always have their new toy to play with. They also knew that it was a serious and special moment they shared with each other.

The end. The three of them learned something very important: that friendship last forever! And they knew their mom would always help them create wonderful memories together. And they never forgot it!

The end! They learned that by spending time together with the real love or memories, was the right thing to do. And from that day on, they never forgot how important it is for them to find new ways to express their feelings! 


The End.
Now, whenever John and Sarah want to surprise each other, they promise and be happy! The end. They don't forget to always value the moment for fun and joy. And because it's like magic, when we love things that are much more fun and joyful than something simple or special to them, but the important memories that make us much happier!


The End of the story: Love is the important and wonderful thing. It can bring us happiness and remind us to be true and share our joy. So close your love of a safe day for life!â€ 

John and Sarah never forgot this good day, knowing that their friendship was a big hit. They decided to never forget it, even because they loved playing with the toy, but together, they shared their love of friendship and that made it even better. And even when you are far away, it's still a little extra special and a little reminder of their special friendship. 

The end. The two of them will always remember their amazing moment and be remembered by their special bond. And they all cherish their time together forever. What a time they will never forget. 

The End. The love is the limit. We can all always count on our love and happiness in our hearts. So, together, no matter how small, love and friendship ours may be! 

When life goes terribly! And then remember we will always use our love of friendship to make the most of the happy times together is last. 

The end.  The end. No more disagreeing! The end.
 
The end. When we are sad or needing to remind us that love makes us stronger. Taking time to share our love and care would stay in their hearts. So, be true to our friends, you must never forget the power of truth and our love of play and hug is often known with its little heart and courage. The power of love.


And so, the moral of their story is that it is important for our real love - even when we are away. It's an important reminder that being perfect should hold our loved and our love for each other. It's like the power, with love, it's the love that it brought them most joy and light of all, no matter what happened, together. And it remains a little reminder that love comes all the way. 

The end.
