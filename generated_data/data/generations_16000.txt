Once upon a time icy there was a little boy. He was standing in the cold snow looking for something to help him stay warm. He wanted to play, but he didn't have an igloo.

The boy looked around, wondering what he could do, when he spotted a long cable in the snow. He walked over to it. He reached out and touched it.

When his fingers touched the cable, he heard a rattling sound and the metal started to move. He looked closer and realised it was a little mouse. The mouse was so scared, it started yelling.

The little boy was surprised to hear the little mouse speak. He quickly grabbed the mouse, hustling it to safety. The mouse was so happy. The little boy kept the mouse safe and warm. Then he ran back inside the house for a warm and cozy nap. 
The end. The little boy smiled as he realized he had made a new friend! He waved goodbye to the mouse and walked off down the path. He was happy to know he could help creatures and animals in need.  He was sure that from now on, he would always come back in the cold winter months! He was sure it was something he could be thankful for. The little boy smiled and enjoyed the cold winter days after. He had found a new life of adventure! 

The End.

This story teaches us that a little brave heart can be our duty to save others. We don't have to stay away from the cold months in the future. We all have the ability to be a big kid that can stand by us if we face the consequences. Just like the little boy used to be! Even though the little boy had thought ahead about the mouse, he was grateful that he didn't need to be afraid to ask for help when he needed it. That way, he could make a difference in his lives.

And, that is the story of the icy snowy winter days. Wherever the mouse is, it will come back looking for new homes, no matter how cold it got! And with that, the little boy was sure heâ€™d never forget that story of his magical winter adventure in the winter. He knew that next time he needed to be extra careful. He also knew that he could always call on the winter for help. 

The little boy was so proud of himself. He had helped the mouse find an icy winter home and the warmth it brought for him! He was sure the magnet would bring them even closer to warmth and love. 

And with that, the little boy smiled, knowing that nothing would ever be the same as a cold winter. But he still had one final glance at the creature, knowing that he had found a new friend. He felt proud and happy that heâ€™d been brave enough to use his smarts to protect the cottage and his home. 

He knew that he too could make a difference and he also knew that he could always rely on himself to help others and make the world a better place. He had truly learned the power of being brave and kind. And he knew the little mouse was one of the best friends it ever had. 

The End!

Moral of the story: Kindness can be found in the most unexpected lands. With patience and courage, big or small. Kindness can find strength in the simplest things. And so Joe has never forgotten the lesson from that little mouse! It pays to be brave and use your gifts to help. With courage and loyalty, anything that can be a wonderful thing. It will always be to reach for the things that you find with courage. A single heart, a big smile. And with courage and creativity, anything is possible.  The end.

And as for his age, the little mouse, it's already known as the Fill winter - when it comes to the warmth and friendship that brings us all closer to your dreams. It also gives us important lessons, like finding a warm and cozy tunnel to keep us warm and safe in the cold! Let us make a difference in our lives. No matter what, until we try its luck and friendship. Enjoy." 

The end.

The end.
By being a little bit of courage, we can always find an answer. But it will always be a little bit sweeter to remember. Kindness in his life, and those in need. And with that the two will be friends forever. 

The end.

The end.

So, the end.
And that is how the little boy and the mouse found comfort in each other's words: use your brain and your courage to do the right thing. By using our courage and trust. That
