Once upon a time 2 friends, Max and Joe, were playing in the garden. Suddenly, Max stepped on a big crack in the ground. Joe was very angry and shouted loudly: "Come play on me! It's so terrible!" But Joe did not listen.

Max knew he had to make John happy. He took Joe's arm and slapped the ground. Smoke filled the air and Max and Joe both started to cry. Then Max said, "Why don't you kick it together and you can still have fun?"

So Joe did. He kicked the crack one more time and the crack was all gone. Joe was delighted and jumped up and down. "Wow! Let's do it again!" he said. And so they did! The crack was gone and there was just a smile on everyone's face.
