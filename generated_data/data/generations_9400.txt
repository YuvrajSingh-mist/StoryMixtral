Once upon a time 3 children, they were playing happily in the park. One of them noticed an exciting line. It was tall and had a big bow around it.

The children ran to the line to have a closer look. It was big and long, with many steps for them to go over and over again. They thought it looked so cool!

But soon, a big man came to it. He began pushing all the children away and then he made the line very slow down.

The children started to cry but they didn't want the man to take the line. So the man scooped up the children and took them away.

The children ran away and never came back. The man had seen their line and was now safe. They felt very sad and cried all the way home. The day ended with the children feeling very embarrassed. They never got to play near the line again. It had been a bad ending. The children had a bad ending. The end. The other children never saw the man with the beautiful line again. But they never knew who had touched his line. It had caused a lot of pain and excitement. But nothing had changed. And the old men would keep him forever. 

The end. The children never got to enjoy their playtime and have such a bad ending. They were still thinking about the broken line, but they wished she had the memory of them. They would never forget the memory that had brought them together. And that one bad thing would happen. The end. Unfortunately, they all never made the same mistake again. They stayed apart for days in the long line. The End. The End. The end.


It is a bad ending for the children. And it is important to be careful with stories that are written around them. Listen to people who know what something bad may happen if you do. Otherwise, you may never see what happens. And, they will always be reminded of the bad ending of their story. Sadly, their lives are not as far apart as it seems. It doesn't reveal the importance of the old man's warning. And even though the old friends never got married, the bad thing that happened in the long line, were gone, never to come back. 

The end.


Moral: Listen to the children, it's important to take regular trips seriously, because a special promise is that you should remember to respect what's behind them. By being open to the danger, the children never forgot it. The end.

This will never happen again. The End.

The end.

Moral: Listen to our parents, take our time to appreciate and listen to their parents! They never know if their wish would come true again! Being too excited and too stubborn can be more pleasant when they least expect it: be careful! 

The End.

Moral: Be careful when you play and always listen to your parents! If you do, you will be able to make a bad call - even if you don't know what's about them!â€

Fores may come true, and the boy and his friends will never forget what their warnings had. They will always remember to be careful of who they trust. It is a reminder to end their days with a bad ending. Unfortunately, it's gone forever. The old man's message of their kind gesture came to the children from the wrong ending. They never forgot it - it was a bad ending, and an awful ending never happened. It brings bad endings, but a reminder that their happiness would never end. 

The moral value of the story is: listen to your warnings as well as they come. It is like a reminder to never let your fear stop you from making your wishes. Listen to the sign and stay true to ourselves. It will always take time to stay, but it is a reminder of the day you can ignore your curiosity and focus on what is beautiful. Respect and remember to stay close to your heart too. Until then, take care of your heart.

The end.
